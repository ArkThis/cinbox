# CInbox: A Common Inbox engine for archiving data


The Common-Inbox (CInbox) is a very flexible engine for moving data, and it is
designed for usage in long-term preservation environments.

It ensures data integrity and can run in most environments (e.g. Linux,
Windows). Further, it allows for plug-ins, pre- and postprocessing scripts and
the definition of a rule set (configuration) for each Inbox. Depending on the
configuration, the data files, metadata, hashes and directory structure will be
handled to migrate automatically and only have user interaction in error cases.
